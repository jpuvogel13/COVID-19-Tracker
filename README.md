# COVID-19-Tracker
This is a COVID-19 tracking application. It provides users with a user-friendly User Interface which shows users up-to-date information on COVID data. This application makes external calls to an API that has data from Johns Hopkins CSSE, which is updated every few hours. Users can search for current Global totals, daily Global totals for a specified date, daily country totals for a specified date, and total current totals for a specified date. Data consists of confirmed, active and recovered cases, deaths and fatality rate. Also, each variable has a seperate variable that is the difference of one variable compared to the day prior. Enjoy!
